# Welcome! 

This is going to be the repo in which you are going to find some of the material we are going to cover in the Python Masterclasses and Workshops! 

----------

## 24th of April 2023

On the first session, we want to get an idea of what are the different levels of expertise in Python and the interests in the room. 

If you haven't programmed before in Python do not worry at all! If you are a pro and you just need some help or brainstorming, this classes are also for you.

You will find 3 tutorials on this repo: 

- *tutorialsArrays* - on arrays, array methods and for loops
- *tutorialsNestedArrays* - on nested arrays, nested for loops 
- *tutorialsFunctions* - on code structuring, functions and recursiveness

**The structure of the tutorials is** 

1. There is a `tutorial.ipynb` with some theory and examples
2. There is an `exercise.ipynb` for application of concepts on a real world dataset. I am an NLP expert, so all the exercises are around NLP concepts!

There is no right or wrong way of going about them!

- If you have **never coded in Python before** probably you need to start elsewhere...a good free resource is this [Harvard Course](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/weeks/0/ ). We can set up a script for you so you can go at your own pace and ask us any questions you have

- If you have some expertise **a good place to start** is in *tutorialsArrays*. Go through the `tutorial.ipynb` and if that is too easy for you jump onto the `exercise.ipynb`!

- If you feel like practicising some tricky exercises (that are often asked on **coding interviews**), then jump to *tutorialsNestedArrays*, to the file `tutorial.ipynb`. 

- If you need extra practise with **functions** or you like the idea of learning how to **organise big scripts of code**, you can start with *tutorialsFunctions*. Bare in mind that for doing this `exercise.ipynb`, it might make sense to firsly do the *tutorialsArrays*'s `exercise.ipynb`

- If you wanna dip your toes into **working with textual data** and Python, then only do the `exercise.ipynb`


### If you have (or you want to have) your own Python project:

- If you have **your own Python project** and you would like a hand debugging, brainstorming how to organise the code or which libraries to use... you could do that too! 

- If you don't have your own Python project, but you would like to have something tangible to play around with and put in your Python portfolio or CV... we **REALLY** encourage this! We can help you choose a cool project that is alinged with your interests... why not start with a google search on examples of python projects for your level?

### What else would you like to see here: 

If theres anything in particular you would like us to cover in a tutorial (how to make charts and graphs, creating machine learning models, natural language processing, how are coding interviews like, creating a website)

Please tell us!!!
